#### Executive Summary

Creating a dating app is much like writing code. Here are some analogies that inspired our project:

- **For Loop Analogy**: Think of a recent event with someone special as a `for` loop in Python. It had a clear start and end, iterating through specific moments.
- **While Loop Analogy**: Sometimes love is like a `while` loop, continuing until a certain condition is met or changed.
- **Perfect on Paper**: Love can look perfect on paper, just like code in an editor. But when you run it (experience it), errors might appear even if everything seems right.
- **Self-Sabotage**: We sometimes self-sabotage, like purposely writing bugs because we're used to working through problems.
- **Joy of Success**: The joy we get when our code works is similar to moments of happiness in love. But sometimes we try to do too much and break it, struggling to get back to when everything ran beautifully.

These analogies remind us that both coding and relationships require patience, effort, and a willingness to learn from mistakes.

**Game of Love** is a mobile dating application designed to help users find meaningful connections. The app targets individuals seeking relationships by providing a platform that combines matching algorithms, user profiles, and messaging features. This project aims to capture market share in the growing online dating sector by offering a user-friendly and secure experience.

#### Inspiration

The inspiration for **Game of Love** came from the realization that love and relationships can be likened to programming concepts. Just as a `for` loop in Python iterates through specific moments with a clear start and end, relationships often go through distinct phases. Similarly, a `while` loop continues until a certain condition is met, much like how love evolves over time. The joy of seeing code run successfully parallels the happiness found in love, while the challenges and errors encountered in coding reflect the ups and downs of relationships. This analogy inspired the creation of a dating app that not only facilitates connections but also acknowledges the complexities and joys of love.

#### Functional Requirements

**User Stories**
- As a single individual, I want to create a profile so that I can showcase my interests and preferences.
- As a user, I want to browse potential matches so that I can find compatible partners.
- As a member, I want to send and receive messages so that I can communicate with matches.
- As a safety-conscious user, I want to report inappropriate behavior so that I can feel secure using the app.
- As a social user, I want to share my dating experiences so that I can connect with others.

#### Technical Requirements Implementation

**Programming Environment and Language**
- Development will be conducted in Python using PyCharm IDE.
- Code will be thoroughly documented with inline comments explaining functionality.
- Implementation will follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines.

**Data Management and Processing**
- User profiles, match data, and messaging history will be stored using Python dictionaries and lists.
- Match algorithms will be implemented using object-oriented programming principles.

**Core Functionality**

**Data Storage and Variables**
- User profile information stored in variables (name, age, interests).
- Match metrics tracked using appropriate data types (integers for age, strings for interests).

**Calculations and Logic**
- Calculate match compatibility using algorithms based on user preferences.
- Implement messaging features with conditional statements to handle different user interactions.

**Program Flow**
- Use loops for browsing profiles and sending messages.
- Implement menu navigation using while loops.
- Handle user interactions through iterative structures.

**Object-Oriented Implementation**
- Create User, Profile, and Match classes.
- Implement methods for creating profiles and matching users.
- Use inheritance for different types of user interactions and messaging features.
